description: "End-to-end flow from search engine outputs to the IPSA database."
---

<Note>
  IPSA can ingest native search engine outputs directly and will run the Universal PSM
  Converter automatically. If you already have IPSA CSVs (or need batch/CI conversion),
  you can generate them with the converter CLI and import them.
</Note>

## Pipeline

<Steps>
  <Step title="Add search engine output (or IPSA CSVs)">
    Drop a supported engine export into IPSA to auto-convert, or provide
    `Identifications.csv` and `Modifications.csv` directly.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Auto-convert and import">
    IPSA detects the engine format, runs the converter internally when needed, and
    imports the resulting CSVs into the database.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Annotate and review">
    IPSA links spectra (RAW/mzML) to identifications and runs annotation on demand.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Data flow

```text
Search engine output
    -> IPSA (auto-detect + Universal PSM Converter)
    -> Identifications.csv + Modifications.csv
    -> IPSA CSV import
    -> IPSA database + annotation engine

Pre-converted IPSA CSVs
    -> IPSA CSV import
    -> IPSA database + annotation engine
```
