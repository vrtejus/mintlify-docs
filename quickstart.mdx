## Get started in three steps

Get your documentation site running locally and make your first customization.

### Step 1: Set up your local environment

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="copy" title="Clone your docs locally">
    During the onboarding process, you created a GitHub repository with your docs content if you didn't already have one. You can find a link to this repository in your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com).
    
    To clone the repository locally so that you can make and preview changes to your docs, follow the [Cloning a repository](https://docs.github.com/en/repositories/creating-and-managing-repositories/cloning-a-repository) guide in the GitHub docs.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion icon="rectangle-terminal" title="Start the preview server">
    1. Install the Mintlify CLI: `npm i -g mint`
    2. Navigate to your docs directory and run: `mint dev`
    3. Open `http://localhost:3000` to see your docs live!
    
    <Tip>Your preview updates automatically as you edit files.</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 2: Deploy your changes

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion icon="github" title="Install our GitHub app">
    Install the Mintlify GitHub app from your [dashboard](https://dashboard.mintlify.com/settings/organization/github-app).
    
    Our GitHub app automatically deploys your changes to your docs site, so you don't need to manage deployments yourself.
</Accordion>
<Accordion icon="palette" title="Update your site name and colors">
    For a first change, let's update the name and colors of your docs site.

    1. Open `docs.json` in your editor.
    2. Change the `"name"` field to your project name.
    3. Update the `"colors"` to match your brand.
    4. Save and see your changes instantly at `http://localhost:3000`.

    <Tip>Try changing the primary color to see an immediate difference!</Tip>
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>

### Step 3: Go live

<Accordion icon="rocket" title="Publish your docs">
  1. Commit and push your changes.
  2. Your docs will update and be live in moments!
</Accordion>

## NuGet quickstart (Windows)

If you want IPSA inside a .NET pipeline, build and install the local package:

```powershell
cd <path-to-ipsa>\nuget
.\build.ps1
dotnet nuget add source ".\artifacts" -n ipsa-local
dotnet add package Ipsa.Native --version 0.1.0 --source ipsa-local
```

Then call the client:

```csharp
using Ipsa.Native;

using var client = new IpsaClient("ipsa.db");
var response = client.Annotate(
    sequence: "PEPTIDE",
    precursorCharge: 2,
    maxFragmentCharge: 2,
    modifications: null,
    mz: new double[] { 100.0, 200.0 },
    intensity: new double[] { 1000.0, 2000.0 },
    tolerance: 20.0,
    toleranceType: "ppm",
    fragmentTypes: new FragmentationParams { B = true, Y = true, PrecursorStandard = true }
);
```

For the full API, see [NuGet (Windows)](/nuget/windows).
